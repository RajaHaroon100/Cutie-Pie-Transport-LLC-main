                                Freight classes help ensure you receive a fair price from carriers and may establish 
                                the applicable limit of liability in the case of loss or damage.

                                <h3 style="font-weight: bold">How it's calculated</h3>
                                Freight classes are calculated based on four characteristics: density, handling, stowability and liability.
